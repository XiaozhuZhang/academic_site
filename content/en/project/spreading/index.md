Cast a pebble into a calm pond, and you will probably see radiating ripples in the form of concentric circles. Take a second and imagine, what will you see if you kick a node of a complex network at rest? How long would it take for a node on the other side of the network to "feel" the impact?

We revealed topology-independent master curves of perturbation spreading in complex networks, by combining an analysis of the transient linearized response of diffusively-coupled networks and numerical simulations of the actual nonlinear network responses. Thereby accuate predictions for perturbation arrival times in target networks with arbitrary topologies can be obtained ([Zhang et al., *Phys. Rev. Lett.* 2020]({{< ref "/publication/zhang2020topological/index.md" >}})).
