Hey there! 

I am Xiaozhu Zhang, now working as an Associate Professor at Tongji University back in Shanghai (= the beloved city I grew up in) after more than 13 years studying and doing research in Germany.

When I was a teenager, a book called "Order out of Chaos" piqued my curiosity on complex systems: complexity lies in practically everything around us, giving rise to order from disarray and certainty from randomness—it's almost magic!

To study complex systems as a science, I travelled alone to Germany, started from Bachelor and went all the way to post-doc. With the help of all my mentors, I've got a much deeper understanding for complex systems, especially the dynamics of complex networks. Yet I found myself facing an ever greater unknown than I was as a teenager: For instance, when and how a single transmission line failure triggers the global breakdown of a power grid with complex topological structure? How can we build more stable, safer and controllable systems by optimizing the connectivities and interactions between the units?

These are 2000-years-old chantings by [*Qu Yuan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_Yuan) (English translation by Stephen Owen in 1996), yet still resonate with me today.

My research interests include (but not limited to): 
- **dynamics of complex networks**,
- **self-organization** and **collective behaviour** in complex systems, and
- **nonlinear dynamics**...

I'm currently working jointly with [*Prof. Gang Yan*](https://physics.tongji.edu.cn/En/FacultyDetail/Gang-YAN) who is an distinguished scientist specialized in network science and brain-inspired systems.

We have now [*openings for post-docs*](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tJV9xqFbHOvHcvlSfAeduQ) and welcome all to apply! :smile:
